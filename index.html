                    <li><strong>Wants:</strong> Desires that enhance quality of life but aren't essential for survival</li>
                    <li><strong>Scarcity:</strong> The basic economic problem that resources are limited but wants are unlimited</li>
                    <li><strong>Opportunity cost:</strong> The next best alternative given up when making a choice</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Importance of specialization:</strong> Specialization in business means focusing on a particular product, service, or production process. It leads to increased efficiency and productivity.</p>
                <p><strong>Purpose of business activity:</strong> To produce goods or provide services that satisfy customer needs and wants while making a profit.</p>
                <p><strong>The concept of adding value:</strong> Adding value is the process of increasing the worth of a product or service. This can be done through manufacturing, marketing, or providing excellent customer service.</p>

                <div class="question">
                    <p>How does specialization contribute to business efficiency?</p>
                    <button class="show-answer">Show Answer</button>
                    <p class="answer" style="display: none;">Specialization contributes to business efficiency by allowing workers and businesses to focus on specific tasks or products.

                <h3>2.1 Motivating employees</h3>
                <p><strong>The importance of a well-motivated workforce:</strong> A motivated workforce is crucial for business success as it leads to increased productivity, reduced absenteeism, and lower staff turnover.</p>
                <p><strong>Human needs and motivation:</strong> Understanding human needs is essential for effective motivation. Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a key theory in this area:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Physiological needs (food, water, shelter)</li>
                    <li>Safety needs (security, stability)</li>
                    <li>Love and belonging needs (friendship, family)</li>
                    <li>Esteem needs (respect, recognition)</li>
                    <li>Self-actualization needs (personal growth, fulfillment)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Motivational theories:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Taylor's theory:</strong> Focuses on financial rewards as the primary motivator</li>
                    <li><strong>Herzberg's two-factor theory:</strong> Distinguishes between hygiene factors (which prevent dissatisfaction) and motivators (which create satisfaction)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Methods of motivation:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Financial rewards: wage, salary, bonus, commission, profit sharing</li>
                    <li>Non-financial methods: job enrichment, job rotation, teamworking, training, promotion opportunities</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="question">
                    <p>How might Herzberg's two-factor theory be applied in a workplace?</p>
                    <button class="show-answer">Show Answer</button>
                    <p class="answer" style="display: none;">Applying Herzberg's two-factor theory in a workplace involves addressing both hygiene factors and motivators:
                        <br><strong>Hygiene factors:</strong> Ensure fair wages, good working conditions, job security, and effective company policies to prevent dissatisfaction.
                        <br><strong>Motivators:</strong> Provide opportunities for achievement, recognition, responsibility, advancement, and personal growth to create satisfaction and motivation.
                        By addressing both aspects, employers can create a work environment that not only prevents dissatisfaction but also actively motivates employees.</p>

                    <p class="answer" style="display: none;">Implementing strong environmental and ethical policies can benefit a business in several ways:

                    <p class="answer" style="display: none;">A significant appreciation of a country's currency can affect businesses in several ways:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Exports become more expensive and potentially less competitive in international markets</li>

                            <li>Businesses may face pressure to reduce prices to remain competitive with cheaper imports</li>
                            <li>Companies with significant overseas operations may see a decrease in the value of their foreign earnings</li>
